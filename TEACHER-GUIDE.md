---

## Part 1: Introduction & Presentation (20 minutes)

### Setup:
1. Load PowerPoint presentation
2. Ensure projector/screen is visible to all students
3. Have model engines ready but covered

### Delivery:

**Slides 1-2: Introduction (3 mins)**
- Introduce topic: "Today we're learning about engine lubrication"
- Explain we'll use model engines for hands-on practice
- Set expectations for the session

**Slides 2-3: What is Friction? (5 mins)**
- Ask: "What happens when you rub your hands together fast?"
- Demonstrate friction = heat + wear
- Emphasize: Without oil, engine would seize in minutes
- Use emojis on slides to maintain engagement

**Slide 4: Why Engines Need Oil (3 mins)**
- Three main reasons: reduce friction, cool engine, prevent damage
- Keep explanations simple and concrete
- Relate to real-world examples (bike chain, door hinge)

**Slides 5-13: The 8 Friction Areas (8 mins)**
- Go through each area systematically
- For each one, cover:
  - WHERE it is (location)
  - WHY it needs oil (function)
- Point out these areas on a model engine if possible
- Keep moving - detailed learning comes in next section

**Slide 14: Summary (1 min)**
- Recap the 8 areas quickly
- Preview the hands-on activity

### Teaching Tips:
- ⚠️ Don't get bogged down in technical details at this stage
- ⚠️ Use lots of visual pointing and gestures
- ⚠️ Check for understanding with simple questions
- ⚠️ Keep energy high - this is scene-setting

## Part 2: Hands-On Activity (40 minutes)

### Setup:
1. Give each student/pair a model engine
2. Open interactive activity on tablets/computers (if available)
3. Distribute printed handouts

### Three Options:

#### **Option A: Digital + Physical (Recommended)**
Students work in pairs with:
- 1 model engine per pair
- 1 tablet/computer per pair running the interactive activity

Process:
1. Student A finds area on physical model
2. Student B clicks to mark it in the app
3. They read the information together
4. Swap roles for next area
5. Complete all 8 areas

**Duration:** 30-35 minutes

#### **Option B: Physical Only**
Students work with model engines and printed handouts only.

Process:
1. Students locate each area on handout table
2. Find it on the physical model
3. Mark it off on handout
4. Read the explanation
5. Answer questions at end

**Duration:** 35-40 minutes

#### **Option C: Digital Only**
Students work individually on computers using interactive activity.

Process:
1. Students use the web activity as a learning tool
2. Refer to handout for additional information
3. Complete all 8 areas
4. View model engine as demonstration

**Duration:** 25-30 minutes

### Your Role During Activity:
- ✅ Circulate the room
- ✅ Check students are on task
- ✅ Answer questions about locations
- ✅ Correct misconceptions
- ✅ Encourage peer discussion
- ✅ Point out areas students are struggling to find
- ✅ Keep students moving if they get stuck

### Common Questions:
**Q: "Is the camshaft the same as the crankshaft?"**
A: No - camshaft is at the top (operates valves), crankshaft is at the bottom (turns rotational motion)

**Q: "Where exactly are the main bearings?"**
A: They support the crankshaft - look for the points where the crankshaft sits in the engine block

**Q: "What's the difference between connecting rod bearings and main bearings?"**
A: Connecting rod bearings connect piston to crankshaft. Main bearings support crankshaft in the block.

### Differentiation:
- **Higher ability:** Ask them to explain to others, identify additional components
- **Lower ability:** Work through first 2-3 areas together as a class, then let them continue
- **SEND students:** Pair with supportive peer, use visual handout, one-on-one check-ins

---

## Part 3: Assessment - Single Player Quiz (15 minutes)

### Setup:
Students complete individual quiz on computers/tablets or as a class on projector.

### Two Approaches:

#### **Individual Assessment:**
- Each student takes quiz on their own device
- You can see who's finishing and who's struggling
- Students can retry if they score low

#### **Class Quiz:**
- Display quiz on projector
- Students write answers on paper
- Go through together
- More guided, less pressure

### Monitoring:
- ✅ Check students aren't just guessing
- ✅ Note common wrong answers
- ✅ Use results to identify areas needing review

### Expected Results:
- **80-100%**: Excellent understanding
- **60-79%**: Good - minor gaps
- **40-59%**: Some understanding - needs review
- **Below 40%**: Significant gaps - reteach

### Follow-Up:
If multiple students score below 60%, spend 10 minutes reviewing:
- The most commonly missed questions
- Clarify misconceptions
- Point back to handout/model engine

---

## Part 4: Multiplayer Competition (Optional, 20 minutes)

### When to Use:
- Revision sessions
- End of unit review
- Fun Friday activity
- Competition between classes

### Setup:
1. Open multiplayer quiz on your device
2. Create room and display code on projector
3. Students join on their devices
4. Keep your screen visible to show live leaderboard

### Running the Competition:
- Wait for all students to join
- Start quiz when ready
- Questions appear simultaneously for everyone
- 15-second timer keeps pace fast
- Live leaderboard adds excitement
- Winner announced at end

### Tips:
- ✅ Create competitive atmosphere
- ✅ Encourage good sportsmanship
- ✅ Emphasize learning over winning
- ✅ Can do multiple rounds
- ✅ Great for engagement

## Assessment & Marking

### Formative Assessment:
During hands-on activity, observe:
- Can student locate areas on physical model?
- Do they understand why each area needs oil?
- Can they explain in their own words?

### Summative Assessment Options:

#### **Option 1: Quiz Score**
- Pass mark: 60% (6/10)
- Merit: 80% (8/10)
- Distinction: 100% (10/10)

#### **Option 2: Handout Questions**
Mark the written questions:
- Question 1: 2 marks
- Question 2: 3 marks (1 per area)
- Question 3: 2 marks
- Question 4: 3 marks
- **Total: 10 marks**

#### **Option 3: Practical Assessment**
Student demonstrates on model engine:
- Identify area (1 mark per area) = 8 marks
- Explain why it needs oil (1 mark per area) = 8 marks
- **Total: 16 marks** (can scale to 10)

## Troubleshooting

### Technical Issues:

**Interactive activity won't load:**
- Check internet connection
- Try different browser
- Use offline handout instead

**Multiplayer quiz not working:**
- Check WebRTC isn't blocked by firewall
- Use single-player quiz instead
- Try personal hotspot

**Files won't download:**
- Right-click and "Save As"
- Check school download permissions
- Use USB drive to transfer

### Engagement Issues:

**Students rushing through:**
- Require them to write notes
- Ask them to explain to a partner
- Give additional questions

**Students off-task:**
- Reduce group sizes
- Set specific checkpoints
- Use timer to create urgency

**Mixed ability classes:**
- Pair high/low ability students
- Provide extension activities
- Offer additional support

---

## Extension Activities

For students who finish early or need stretch:

1. **Research Task**
   - Investigate different types of engine oil (5W-30, 10W-40)
   - What do the numbers mean?

2. **Diagram Task**
   - Draw and label an engine showing oil flow paths
   - Show how oil travels from sump to friction areas

3. **Compare & Contrast**
   - Two-stroke vs four-stroke lubrication
   - Petrol vs diesel engine differences

4. **Maintenance Task**
   - Research how to check oil level
   - What does oil look like when it needs changing?

---

## Adaptations for Different Settings

### Whole Class (30+ students):
- Use presentation for introduction
- Rotate groups through model engines
- Individual quiz assessment
- Skip multiplayer (too many)

### Small Group (10-15 students):
- More time with model engines
- Pair work encouraged
- Multiplayer quiz works well
- More teacher support available

### One-to-One/Small Intervention:
- Work through presentation together
- Extended time with model engine
- Verbal assessment instead of quiz
- Focus on core 4-5 friction areas

### Online/Remote Learning:
- Record presentation or deliver via video call
- Students use interactive web activities only
- Virtual quiz competitions
- Email handout as PDF
